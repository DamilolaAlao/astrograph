// This models represent GraphQL types from schema.
//
// Conventions:
//
// 1. Models must not contain relations: we load related via resolvers (ex: Transactions have no an array of
//    operations).
// 2. Models must have sufficient data to load related from either database or DGraph (ex: Account has
//    inflationDest as scalar, not as an Account).
